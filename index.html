        My name is Antonio Linero; welcome to my website! I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Florida State University. I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Florida, under the direction of Professor Hani Doss and Professor Michael Daniels. I received my B.S. from the University of Florida where I studied Finance.

            My research is broadly focused on developing flexible Bayesian methods. My work has focused on developing appropriate Bayesian methods for complex longitudinal data, as well as developing model selection and variable selection tools within the Bayesian nonparametric framework for high dimensional problems. I am also pursuing research in Bayesian nonparametrics for missing data and causal inference problems in which analysts are forced to (i) confront the curse of dimensionality when estimating low-dimensional effects of interest and (ii) are required to make in-principle unverifiable assumptions. Developing flexible Bayesian nonparametric models which give robust inferences in these scenarios is fraught with subtle challenges.
